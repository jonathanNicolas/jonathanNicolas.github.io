        <h2>Describing and comparing arrays and hashes</h2>
        <p>Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>nums = Array[1, 2, 3, 4,5]</p>
        <p>Hashes are similar to arrays in that they are indexed collection of object references. However, while you index arrays with integers, you can index a hash with objects of any types: strings, regular expressions, and so on. When you store a value in a hash, you actually supply two objects - the index (normally called the key) and the value. You can subsequently retrieve the value by indexing the hash with the same key. The values in a hash can be objects of any type.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>names = Hash.new </br>
names[1] = "Jonathan"</br>
names[2] = "Simon"</br></p>

<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
We decided to each do our own layout but still nice to have someone to give input
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, it shows the layout clearly
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Minimanlistic look is what we both prefered
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
nav and div
